# API

The {class}`diffbank.bank.Bank` class provides a simple interface to access all
the functionality in `diffbank`. If you prefer a more functional interface, you
can also use the functions in the {mod}`diffbank.metric` and {mod}`diffbank.utils`
modules.

A few waveform and detector noise models are included in the {mod}`diffbank.waveforms`
and {mod}`diffbank.noise` modules. Finally, the {mod}`diffbank.constants` module
defines a few physical constants. Note that `diffbank` uses SI units.
