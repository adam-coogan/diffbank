# diffbank

`diffbank` makes creating template banks for gravitational wave searches simple
and fast. In a nutshell, it combines differentiable waveforms based on the
[jax](https://github.com/google/jax/) framework with a new variant on [random
template bank generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/0809.5223). Read through the links
below to get started.
